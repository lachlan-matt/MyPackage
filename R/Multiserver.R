#' Multiserver
#'
#' @description This function is used to simulate how customers will go through a first come, first serve queuing system as long as "fate" has already decided when each customer will arrive and their service times
#'
#' @param Arrivals text string; This is the time of arrival
#' @param ServiceTimes text string; This is the time that the service takes
#' @param NumServers text string; This is the number of available servers
#'
#' @return A tibble outlining the arrival time, time the service began, the chosen server and the time the service ends

  # Feed customers through a multiserver queue system to determine each
  # customer's transition times.

  NumCust = length(Arrivals)  #  number of customer arrivals
  # When each server is next available (this will be updated as the simulation proceeds):
  AvailableFrom <- rep(0, NumServers)
  # i.e., when the nth server will next be available

  # These variables will be filled up as the simulation proceeds:
  ChosenServer <- ServiceBegins <- ServiceEnds <- rep(0, NumCust)

  # ChosenServer = which server the ith customer will use
  # ServiceBegins = when the ith customer's service starts
  # ServiceEnds = when the ith customer's service ends

  # This loop calculates the queue system's "Transitions by Customer":

    # go to next available server
    avail <-  min(AvailableFrom)
    ChosenServer[i] <- which.min(AvailableFrom)
    # service begins as soon as server & customer are both ready
